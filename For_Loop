// Print Masai School 
Description

You are given a number stored in a variable with the namenum

You have to printMasai School, as many times as the number stored in the variablenum


for (let i=1; i<=num;i++){
        console.log("Masai School")
    }
  
}





// Loop 1 to N 
Description

You are given a number stored in a variable with the namenum

You have to print all the numbers from 1 tonum, including num as well.



for(let i=1; i<=num; i++){
        console.log(i)
    }
    


// From A to B 
Description

You are given two numbers, stored in variables with the following names

max, min




for(let i=min;i<max;i++){
        console.log(i)
    }
    
    
}




// Multiplication Table of N 
Description

Given a number, stored in the variable with the namenum

Print the multiplication table of the value stored innum

For example, if the value stored in




   let a=0;
    for(let i=1; i<=10 ;i++){
        a=i*num;
        console.log(a);
    }
    
}






// Move 2 Ahead 
Description

You are given a number, stored in a variable with the namenum

Print all the odd numbers lesser than or equal to the value stored innum

Only those numbers need to be printed which are greater than zero

For example, given that the value stored innum = 12


 for (let i=1; i<=num;i++){
        if(!(i%2==0)){
            console.log(i)
        }
    }
    
    
}







// Move 2 Ahead II
Description

You are given a number stored in a variable with the following name,num

You have to print all the even numbers greater than zero, and less than or equal to the value stored innum

For example, if the value stored innum = 13




   for (let i=1;i<=num;i++){
        if(i%2==0){
            console.log(i);
        }
    }
    
}





// Even Sum Below N 
Description

You are given a number, stored in a variable with the namenum

Find the sum of all even numbers greater than zero, and less than or equal to the value stored innum

For example, if the value stored innum = 5




 let sum = 0;
    for (let i=1;i<=num;i++){
        if(i%2==0){
            sum=sum+i;
        }
    }
    console.log(sum);
  
}









// Odd Sum Below N 
Description

You are given a number, stored in a variable with the namenum

Find the sum of all odd numbers, greater than 0, and less than or equal to the value stored innum

Finally, print the sum

For example, if the value stored innum = 5







    let sum=0;
    for(let i=1;i<=num;i++){
        if(!(i%2==0)){
            sum=sum+i
        }
    }
    console.log(sum);
    
}









// Mod of 10 II 
Description

You are given a number stored in a variable with the namenum

Find out the value obtained from the expressioni % 10, whereiconsists of all the values from 1 to the value stored innum, includingnum



  let a=0;
    for(let i=1 ; i<=num;i++){
        a=i%10;
        console.log(a);
    }
}
